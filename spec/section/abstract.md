## Abstract {#abstract}

RML logical views is an extension of the RDF Mapping Language (RML) that increases the language's capability to
construct RDF datasets from nested input data, to join datasources (also across data hierarchies),
and to handle data sources that mix source formats,
by allowing to specify a logical view: a flattened, source format-agnostic view
over one or more existing data sources.
Additionally, it provides a mechanism to express relationships between data sources,
as well as additional information about their fields, through structural annotations.

This document describes RML logical views through definitions and examples.
